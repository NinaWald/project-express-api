# Project Express API

This week's project is to start your backend journey by creating an API using Express. Your API should have at least a couple of RESTful endpoints which return either an array of data or a single item.

## The problem

**What you need to do**

✓ Your API should have at least 2 routes. Try to push yourself to do more, though!

✓ A minimum of one endpoint to return a **collection** of results (array of elements).

✓ A minimum of one endpoint to return a **single** result (single element).

✓ Your API should be [RESTful]

I used 1375 Netflix titles and some data about them.
